      <description>Cloudprober is a monitoring software that makes it super-easy to monitor availability and performance of various components of your system. Cloudprober employs the &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo; monitoring model. It runs probes against (or on) your components to verify that they are working as expected. For example, it can run a probe to verify that your frontends can reach your backends. Similarly it can run a probe to verify that your in-Cloud VMs can actually reach your on-premise systems.</description>

      <description>Cloudprober&amp;rsquo;s main task is to run probes. A probe executes something, usually against a set of targets, to verify that the systems are working as expected. For example, an HTTP probe executes an HTTP request against a web server to verify that the web server is available. Cloudprober probes run repeatedly at a configured interval and export probe results as a set of metrics.
A probe is defined as a set of the following fields:</description>
